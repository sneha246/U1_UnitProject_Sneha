# U1_UnitProject_Sneha
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This project was started from sratch, it was not a continuation of any previous project. In this game, the bookshelf allows the user to chose which book in order to see my favorite quote from that certain novel.  <p>
<h2> Inspiration </h2>
For this project, I wanted to create something that actually looks like it could have been created by me, hence the books part. As well as that, I wanted for the users to be able to explore the various books and what kind of quotes were chosen from each one.
